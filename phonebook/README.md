### pseudocode!  

First, **pick up** the phone book. 
Open it to the middle...*somewhere*.
Look through the names on the page, and if you were magic, you will see ***SMITH***. In that case, call ***MIKE SMITH***.  
If you weren't magic, figure out if Smith is before or after the page you originally opened to. 
If it is **before**, open the book to the middle of the beggining and true middle, if it is **after**, open the book to the middle of the true middle and end.
Repeat these steps, narrowing in on the name **SMITH**.  
If Smith does not appear, give up.
